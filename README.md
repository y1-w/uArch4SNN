Spiking Neural Network (SNN) coprocessor for convolutional and fully-connected layers

The implementation of the SNN coprocessor relies on the High-level synthesis (HLS) design files provided here. There are two sets of files for spiking fully connected neural networks (hls_fcsnn_v42) and spiking convolutional neural networks (hls_csnn_v7). 

The instruction set implemented in *hls_fcsnn_v42* is shown in the table below.
